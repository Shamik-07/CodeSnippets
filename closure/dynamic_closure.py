'''
Module to calculate the mean of a stream of numbers.

This uses a dynamic enclosure
i.e. `mean_of_a_stream_of_numbers` doesn't take any argument.

The closure assigned to calc_mean retains the state of arg_ls
between successive calls.
Even though you define arg_ls in mean_of_a_stream_of_numbers(),
itâ€™s still available in the closure, so you can modify it.
In this case, arg_ls works as kind of dynamic enclosing state.
